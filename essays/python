# Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.  
It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.  
Python emphasizes code readability through its clean syntax, which allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to many other programming languages.

## Key Features
- **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python’s syntax is straightforward, making it a popular choice for beginners.
- **Versatile**: Supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Comes with a rich standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
- **Interpreted Language**: Code is executed line-by-line, which simplifies testing and debugging.

## Common Uses
- **Web Development** (e.g., Django, Flask)
- **Data Science and Machine Learning** (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow)
- **Automation and Scripting**
- **Game Development**
- **Desktop Applications**

## Example Code
Here’s a simple Python program that prints `"Hello, World!"`:

```python

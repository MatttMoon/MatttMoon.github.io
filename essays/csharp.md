# C#

C# (pronounced *C-sharp*) is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.  
It was introduced in **2000** as part of the .NET framework and is widely used for building desktop applications, web applications, games, and more.

## Key Features
- **Object-Oriented**: Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- **Type-Safe**: Strong type-checking reduces common programming errors.  
- **Rich Standard Library**: Provides built-in functionality for networking, file I/O, and more.  
- **Cross-Platform**: With .NET Core and .NET 6+, C# can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
- **Integrated with Visual Studio**: Offers powerful tools for development and debugging.  

## Common Uses
- **Windows Applications** (WinForms, WPF, UWP)  
- **Web Development** (ASP.NET Core)  
- **Game Development** (Unity Engine uses C# as its primary scripting language)  
- **Cloud and Enterprise Applications**  

## Example Code
This is actually a program in C# that prints `"Hello, World!"`:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}

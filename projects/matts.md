## Task Manager Application

This is a desktop Task Manager app I built in **Python** using **PyQt5** for the interface and **SQLite** for the database. I made it for my Principles of System Design course, but I also designed it to be something I’d use.

**Features:**
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks complete and track progress
- Earn XP points and level up for completing tasks *(gamification for motivation)*
- User login system to manage personal accounts
- Edit username inside the app

**Tech Used:**
- Python  
- PyQt5  
- SQLite  

All data is stored locally in SQLite, so it’s simple to run without a server.  
I’m planning future updates like voice control and a web-based version.

This project helped me practice connecting a Python GUI to a database, managing state, and building features that are actually useful in daily life.

## Reflection
Task Manager V2 demonstrates how I can take a simple idea (basic task manager) and grow it into a **full productivity tool**.  
This project highlights my skills in **UI/UX design, database management, feature iteration, and user-centered design**. It also shows my ability to design scalable software where **new features integrate smoothly** into existing systems.
